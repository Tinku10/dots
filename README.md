#### Here lies all the dots united to make up the configuration I want.

<br>

I am trying out **GNU stow** to manage my dotfiles.

<br>

#### NOTE

The repositories I used previously for dotfiles management got too cluttered
without proper management and had a lot of things I don't want to manage. So I
thought I should redo the whole work. So those two
repositories([Tinku10/dotfiles](https://www.github.com/Tinku10/dotfiles) and
[Tinku10/dotconfig](https://www.github.com/Tinku10/dotconfig)) will be
deprecated.

#### INFO

- I still have to fine tune some of the files present here. 
- I manage Neovim as a separate repo, which you can find
  [here](https://www.github.com/Tinku10/LightNvim)
- Install scripts are very basic for now. They just stow each directory.

#### TODO

- [X] Manage dotfiles with stow
- [ ] Make the install script better
- [ ] Fine tune each dotfile

*This README will be updated soon.*
